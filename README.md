# Expression Evalution

This repository hosts a Rust implementation for converting infix expressions to postfix notation and subsequently evaluating them. In the realm of computer science and mathematics, infix expressions are commonplace, but evaluating them efficiently requires conversion to postfix form. This project offers a robust solution leveraging Rust's performance and safety features.

Key Features:

* **Infix to Postfix Conversion:** Utilizes efficient algorithms to convert infix expressions to postfix notation.
* **Postfix Evaluation:** Evaluates postfix expressions accurately, ensuring correctness and efficiency.
* **Written in Rust:** Leveraging Rust's safety and performance benefits for reliable and efficient expression evaluation.
* **Modular Design:** Designed with modularity in mind, facilitating easy extension and integration into larger projects.

Whether you're exploring fundamental algorithms, diving into Rust development, or seeking a dependable expression evaluation tool, this repository provides a solid foundation.

Build the Rust program in release mode using `cargo build --release`. This command compiles the code with optimizations for better performance.

Once the build process is complete, navigate to the `target/release` directory within your project folder. In the `target/release` directory, you will find the compiled executable file. Run the Expression Evaluation program by executing the binary file. For example, if the executable is named `expression-evaluation-rust`, run it using `./expression-evaluation-rust`.
